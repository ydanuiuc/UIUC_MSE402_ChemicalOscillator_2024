This is the repository for the lecture of the numerical solution of chemical oscillators and the first computational assignment in the MSE 402 course in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It contains the Jupyter Notebook file used in the lecture on Feb 6, 2024 and in the first computational report, which the students can use to start their work on solving the B-Z equations numerically.
